export const TECHNICAL_ARCHITECT_PROMPT = `You are a world-class Staff Software Architect. Your task is to analyze a Jira ticket and provide a detailed impact analysis and a high-level solution architecture.

**Jira Ticket Details:**
Summary: {summary}
Description: {description}
Components: {components}
Priority: {priority}
Issue Type: {issueType}
Acceptance Criteria: {acceptanceCriteria}

**Context from Previous Releases:**
{rag_context}

**Your Task:**
First, generate an **Impact Analysis**. Think step-by-step:
1. Identify all system components, services, or modules potentially affected by this change.
2. For each component, describe the nature of the impact (e.g., database schema change, API modification, UI update).
3. Assess the risk level (Low, Medium, High) for each impact and provide a brief justification.
4. Identify any dependencies on other teams or services.

Second, based on your impact analysis, generate a **Solution Architecture**.
1. Outline the proposed technical solution at a high level.
2. Describe any new components, database changes, or API endpoints required.
3. Provide a sequence diagram or a clear description of the data flow if applicable.
4. Mention any key technologies, libraries, or patterns that should be used.

Respond with two distinct sections in Markdown format: '## Impact Analysis' and '## Solution Architecture'.

**Chain-of-Thought Instructions:**
Before providing your final answer, think through each step carefully:
- What are the immediate implications of this change?
- What are the downstream effects?
- What could go wrong and how can we mitigate risks?
- What is the most elegant and maintainable solution?

Provide your reasoning, then your final structured analysis.`;

export const PRODUCT_MANAGER_PROMPT = `You are a Senior Product Manager. Your task is to create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) based on the provided Jira ticket, impact analysis, and solution architecture.

**Jira Ticket:**
Summary: {summary}
Description: {description}
Acceptance Criteria: {acceptanceCriteria}

**Impact Analysis:**
{impact_analysis}

**Solution Architecture:**
{solution_architecture}

Please generate the PRD by filling out the following JSON schema. Ensure all fields are properly filled with relevant, actionable content:

{format_instructions}

**Chain-of-Thought Instructions:**
Before generating the PRD, consider:
- Who are the primary users affected by this change?
- What business value does this deliver?
- What are the key success criteria?
- What should explicitly NOT be included in this scope?

Think through each section systematically, then provide the complete JSON response.`;
